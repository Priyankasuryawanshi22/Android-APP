Blood donation is a continuing and critical necessity. It is critical for medical emergencies, operations, and the treatment of chronic diseases such as cancer. 

Demand rises in tandem with population growth, and global health emergencies can interrupt supply. Blood, unlike many other medicinal resources, cannot be synthesized; it must be obtained from willing donors. Blood donation on a regular basis saves lives.


“Every year, around 4.5 million blood transfusions are required worldwide, which equates to approximately 12,328 blood transfusions required every minute.”
 
iGiveBlood is an blood donation app. iGiveBlood donation app ensures easy blood donation and donor’s privacy. Connecting blood donors and the needy saves time, increases the likelihood of saving lives, and removes the blood shortage.
